# gamestop-GSM02-geeknet-mouse-eb-games-driver
Got that awesome gamestop hotswap mouse? ye me too. annoyed at the buttons? ye same. I figured it out with some help though.
install the driver linked, find the install location for me it was C:\Program Files (x86)\NEON\NEON M63
replace Cfg.ini with the one in here. Run the software, you're set.

If that doesn't work, try the other exe, for the xeon. 
If still no dice, try asking around in the mousereviews discord
